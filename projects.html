                        This was an end of course project that I worked on with three others for an Informatics class at UW. Our goal for this project was to create an online educational platform primarily geared toward those affected by homelessness. The platform was intended to help both those affected by homelessness and those who are not. To do that we focused on correcting some the misinformation that is spread about the systemic problem of homelessness and by connecting those who are affected to resources that could help them navigate the system.

                        After messing around with Arch Linux in the early part of 2016 I decided to make it my 'daily driver' operating system, a choice that I could not be happier with.  It's a great lightweight distro that has excellent documentation via the <a class="about_links" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">wiki</a>. Having a rock solid Linux file system and full control over permissions is great; add in the near limitless level of customization to optimize workflow and you've got an all around fantastic operating system.

                        Pictured above is a (relatively) recent screenshot of what my desktop looks like (albeit a bit cluttered). I don't think I would recommend Arch to a first time 'nix user as the initial install is a very barebones Linux experience with the modus operandi being 'roll your own'. That being said, for someone with a bit of experience it’s a great weekend project, one that you can sandbox quite easily to avoid screwing up your machine.

                        In the future I would like to do a full guide to getting started with Arch as well as my favorite packages. In the meantime, <a class="about_links" href="https://www.archlinux.org/">here's</a> a link to Arch Linux's page for anyone who feels inclined to check it out.
